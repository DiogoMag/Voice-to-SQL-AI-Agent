## Architecture

🔄 Data Flow Overview
- Voice Input: User speaks a query.
- Speech-to-Text: Converts voice to text (e.g., Whisper).
- NLP Interpretation: AI agent parses intent and generates SQL.
- SQL Validation: Sanitizes and validates the query.
- Database Execution: Runs the query on MySQL.
- Response Generation: Formats results into natural language.
- (Optional) Text-to-Speech: Speaks the answer back to the user.

🧱 Component Breakdown
- voice_input.py: Captures and transcribes voice.
- nlp_agent.py: Uses LLM to interpret and generate SQL.
- sql_executor.py: Connects to MySQL and runs queries.
- response_builder.py: Converts raw results into readable answers.
- main.py: Orchestrates the full pipeline.
